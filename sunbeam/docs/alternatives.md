Sunbeam wouldn't exist without taking inspirations from these incredible tools.

Make sure to check them out, they might be a better fit for your use case:

- [raycast](https://raycast.com): Sunbeam shamelessly copy most of raycast UX, and nomenclature in it's api. Even the project name is a reference to raycast.
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf): Sunbeam tries to take inspiration from fzf, but it's not a drop-in replacement. Sunbeam is designed to be used as a launcher, not as a fuzzy finder.
- [kit](https://www.scriptkit.com): Kit also focus on scripting. The plugins are primarily written in javascript.
- [slapdash](https://slapdash.com): Slapdash feature-set is quite close to sunbeam. Sadly, slapdash development seems to be stalled, and it's not open source.
